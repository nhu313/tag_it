# Code of Conduct
Contact: nhu313@gmail.com

As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

The goal of the Code of Conduct is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can work and use this project effectively, productively, and respectfully, even in face of disagreements. The Code of Conduct also provides a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

## Our Values

These are the values Elixir developers should aspire to:

  * Be friendly and welcoming
  * Be patient
    * Remember that people have varying communication styles and that not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
  * Be thoughtful
    * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
    * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
  * Be respectful
    * In particular, respect differences of opinion. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.
  * Avoid destructive behavior
    * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
    * Unconstructive criticism: state how things can be improve. If it's an opinion, don't state it as a fact. Ex: "I think this way is better because..."
    * Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments).

The following actions are explicitly forbidden:

  * Insulting, demeaning, hateful, or threatening remarks.
  * Discrimination based on age, disability, gender, nationality, race, religion, sexuality, or similar personal characteristic.
  * Bullying or systematic harassment.
  * Unwelcome sexual advances.
  * Incitement to any of these.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, project maintainers commit themselves to fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting a project maintainer at nhu313@gmail.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
